the script is a fragment based conversion of CG representation into atomistic.

The script has 2 outputs:

The 1st requires no information other than the fragment corresponding to the bead
The script will convert any protein using a basic de novo method of fragment alignment to the CG beads.

The 2nd maps a users supplied atomistic structure onto the the CG representation. 
The mapped structure is then steered for a very short period to fit the CG coordinates.

example input.

python -c cg_input.pdb -a atomistic_input.pdb -d user_supplied_database -v (3 level verbosity -vvv) -clean (removes temp file after cg2at)
