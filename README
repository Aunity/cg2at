the script is a fragment based conversion of CG representation into atomistic.

The script has 2 outputs:

The 1st requires no information other than the fragment corresponding to the bead
The script will convert any protein using a basic de novo method of fragment alignment to the CG beads.

The 2nd maps a users supplied atomistic structure onto the the CG representation. 
The mapped structure is then steered for a very short period to fit the CG coordinates.

The following flags are available:
-c cg_input.pdb (can accept pdb/gro/tpr [required])
-a atomistic_input.pdb (can accept pdb/gro/tpr[optional])
-d user_supplied_database (can ignore for now unless you feel like making some fragments)
-v (3 level verbosity -vvv) (use just -v to get the run times etc)
-clean (removes temp file after cg2at) (small amount of cleaning of directories)

example input.

python cg2at.py -c cg_input.pdb -a atomistic_input.pdb -v -clean
